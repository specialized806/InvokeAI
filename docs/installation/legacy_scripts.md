# Legacy Scripts

!!! warning "Legacy Scripts"

    We recommend using the Invoke Launcher to install and update Invoke. It's a desktop application for Windows, macOS and Linux. It takes care of a lot of nitty gritty details for you.

    Follow the [quick start guide](./quick_start.md) to get started.

!!! tip "Use the installer to update"

    Using the installer for updates will not erase any of your data (images, models, boards, etc). It only updates the core libraries used to run Invoke.

    Simply use the same path you installed to originally to update your existing installation.

Both release and pre-release versions can be installed using the installer. It also supports install through a wheel if needed.

Be sure to review the [installation requirements] and ensure your system has everything it needs to install Invoke.

## Getting the Latest Installer

Download the `InvokeAI-installer-vX.Y.Z.zip` file from the [latest release] page. It is at the bottom of the page, under **Assets**.

After unzipping the installer, you should have a `InvokeAI-Installer` folder with some files inside, including `install.bat` and `install.sh`.

## Running the Installer

!!! tip

    Windows users should first double-click the `WinLongPathsEnabled.reg` file to prevent a failed installation due to long file paths.

Double-click the install script:

=== "Windows"

    ```sh
    install.bat
    ```

=== "Linux/macOS"

    ```sh
    install.sh
    ```

!!! info "Running the Installer from the commandline"

    You can also run the install script from cmd/powershell (Windows) or terminal (Linux/macOS).

!!! warning "Untrusted Publisher (Windows)"

    You may get a popup saying the file comes from an `Untrusted Publisher`. Click `More Info` and `Run Anyway` to get past this.

The installation process is simple, with a few prompts:

- Select the version to install. Unless you have a specific reason to install a specific version, select the default (the latest version).
- Select location for the install. Be sure you have enough space in this folder for the base application, as described in the [installation requirements].
- Select a GPU device.

!!! info "Slow Installation"

    The installer needs to download several GB of data and install it all. It may appear to get stuck at 99.9% when installing `pytorch` or during a step labeled "Installing collected packages".

    If it is stuck for over 10 minutes, something has probably gone wrong and you should close the window and restart.

## Running the Application

Find the install location you selected earlier. Double-click the launcher script to run the app:

=== "Windows"

    ```sh
    invoke.bat
    ```

=== "Linux/macOS"

    ```sh
    invoke.sh
    ```

Choose the first option to run the UI. After a series of startup messages, you'll see something like this:

```sh
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:9090 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Copy the URL into your browser and you should see the UI.

## Improved Outpainting with PatchMatch

PatchMatch is an extra add-on that can improve outpainting. Windows users are in luck - it works out of the box.

On macOS and Linux, a few extra steps are needed to set it up. See the [PatchMatch installation guide](./patchmatch.md).

## First-time Setup

You will need to [install some models] before you can generate.

Check the [configuration docs] for details on configuring the application.

## Updating

Updating is exactly the same as installing - download the latest installer, choose the latest version, enter your existing installation path, and the app will update. None of your data (images, models, boards, etc) will be erased.

!!! info "Dependency Resolution Issues"

    We've found that pip's dependency resolution can cause issues when upgrading packages. One very common problem was pip "downgrading" torch from CUDA to CPU, but things broke in other novel ways.

    The installer doesn't have this kind of problem, so we use it for updating as well.
