# Documentation

Documentation is an important part of any open source project. It provides a clear and concise way to communicate how the software works, how to use it, and how to troubleshoot issues. Without proper documentation, it can be difficult for users to understand the purpose and functionality of the project.

## Contributing

All documentation is maintained in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI). If you come across documentation that is out of date or incorrect, please submit a pull request with the necessary changes.

When updating or creating documentation, please keep in mind Invoke is a tool for everyone, not just those who have familiarity with generative art.
